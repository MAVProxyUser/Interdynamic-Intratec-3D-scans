# Folder Structure
This folder contains the 3D Mesh scans and STEP files from Phase one combined into one F3D project. The STEP file sans mesh is also located within. 

The individual TEMPLATE files have been combined into a multi-page dimensional accuracy measurement booklet. 
Additionally said booklet has been filled out with the use of calipers on the real tubes.  

The individual measurements have been archived in the .csv file for easy readibility, or analysis. 
An Apple .numbers file is also included with the same info. A small analysis from Claud AI is included.
